My Arduino Projects

PIR Sensor - this is sample code for triggering a pin to high when motion is detected. I followed the same steps 
in the makezine article 'couch monkey guardian' (http://makezine.com/projects/monkey-couch-guardian/) to 
trigger a halloween doorbell for my kids.

LCD-Scroll - this is sample code for scrolling text on a 2x16 lcd screen. I found the built in scrolling functions
not useful, so I created one using a character array.
