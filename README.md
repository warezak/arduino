My Arduino Projects

PIR Sensor - this is sample code for triggering a pin to high when motion is detected. I followed the same steps 
in the makezine article 'couch monkey guardian' (http://makezine.com/projects/monkey-couch-guardian/) to 
trigger a halloween doorbell for my kids.

LCD-Scroll - this is sample code for scrolling text on a 2x16 lcd screen. I found the built in scrolling functions
not useful, so I created one using a character array.

Twitter to LCD - this arduino script will read an html file and display the contents on the LCD. I have my webserver 
connected to my twitter account, displaying my twitter feed in a simple 2 line format. The arduino connects to my 
webserver and displays the contents on the lcd. You can see it in action here: http://youtu.be/XnlK4zlACsE
